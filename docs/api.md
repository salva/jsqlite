# Public API contract

Status: **Stage 1 contract, NONFUNCTIONAL**. The declarations in `src/index.ts` are
type-only scaffolding: this repository does not yet open a database, prepare SQL,
or execute a statement. Stage 2 will build the oracle/test harness; later stages
will translate the engine. Examples specify intended usage, not currently runnable
query demonstrations.

This is the singular public contract. It maps the read-only-relevant SQLite 3.53.4
C API to browser-safe named ESM declarations while retaining explicit JS boundary
behavior. Product scope and permanent exclusions remain in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## Import and values

```ts
import { open, JSQLiteError } from "jsqlite2";
import type {
  Connection, Statement, SqliteValue, SqliteStorageClass,
} from "jsqlite2";
```

`SqliteValue` is `null | bigint | number | string | Uint8Array`:

| SQLite storage class | JavaScript value |
|---|---|
| NULL | `null` |
| INTEGER | signed 64-bit `bigint` |
| REAL | IEEE-754 `number` |
| TEXT | `string` |
| BLOB | `Uint8Array` |

INTEGER accepts only `-9223372036854775808n..9223372036854775807n`. A value outside
that interval is JS `misuse`, not `SQLITE_RANGE` (which is used for an invalid bind
index). REAL and INTEGER stay distinct even when a REAL is integral. Binding NaN
binds SQL NULL; positive and negative infinity remain REAL, following
`sqlite3VdbeMemSetDouble` (`src/vdbemem.c`). Strings may contain NUL. Inputs are
copied when bound. Every returned BLOB is a fresh copy owned by the caller; strings
and scalar values are JS values. Thus subsequent conversion, step, reset, finalize,
or close cannot mutate a value already returned to the caller.

## Opening and residency

```ts
open(source: string | URL | Request, options?: OpenOptions): Promise<Connection>
```

`open` is the only acquisition boundary. It fetches and validates one immutable
main-database snapshot, then retains the complete file in bounded in-memory byte
storage for the connection lifetime. It follows redirects as Fetch does and does
not fetch WAL, journals, attached databases, or any SQL-selected URL. Success means
all bytes are resident; there are no hidden asynchronous page reads. Consequently
`prepare`, binding, metadata access, reset, finalize, and close are synchronous;
`step` is asynchronous so execution can yield between bounded work chunks.

The implementation constructs a new `Request` using caller `fetchOptions` and the
operation signal, but defaults to `credentials: "omit"`, `cache: "default"`, and
`redirect: "follow"`. Caller options may override these defaults, including
credentials. `fetchOptions.signal` is excluded to avoid two competing signals;
use `OpenOptions.signal`. A supplied `Request` contributes its URL and options,
then explicit `fetchOptions` override them; the API still forces the operation
signal. Transport, HTTP (non-2xx), CORS, unavailable/opaque body, premature EOF,
and body-stream failures are `transport`, not SQLite errors. HTTP success does not
imply a valid database.

`maxFileBytes` is checked against trustworthy declared length when available and
while streaming, before retaining excess data. Unsupported reserved bytes,
recovery-requiring snapshots, malformed headers/pages, or unsupported storage
features fail explicitly as documented under errors. The eventual engine must
support the SPEC's UTF-8, UTF-16le, and UTF-16be database encodings.

`signal` is observed before and during streaming and bounded work. `timeoutMs` is
a finite nonnegative duration measured from operation entry. Zero permits only
already-completed checks. Aborting wins over timeout if abort is already observable;
otherwise the first observed condition wins. Timeout does not abort the caller's
controller. Open failure owns and releases partial buffers and exposes no
connection.

## Connection and preparation

A connection owns its statements. Operations on one connection are serialized:
while `open` or `step` is pending, starting another stateful connection/statement
operation throws `JSQLiteError(kind: "misuse")`; accessors for the current row of
the stepping statement are also unavailable until its promise settles. Separate
connections may overlap. This deterministic rejection avoids races rather than
silently queueing them.

```ts
const { statement, tail, tailOffset } = db.prepare(sql, options);
```

`prepare` compiles at most the first statement. Empty, whitespace-only, and
comment-only SQL succeeds with `statement === null`. `tailOffset` is the exact
number of UTF-8 bytes consumed, and `tail` is the exact unconsumed JS-string suffix.
The implementation must map the parser boundary back to a Unicode scalar boundary;
it never splits a surrogate pair or returns a replacement-normalized suffix.
Malformed unpaired JS surrogates are `misuse`, because they have no lossless UTF-8
encoding. SQL parse/compile failure returns no handle and throws a `sqlite` error.
`maxSqlBytes` applies to encoded bytes. Public prepare flags are omitted until a
read-only-relevant behavior is implemented; this is the v2 retained-SQL model,
including future bounded automatic reprepare.

Parameter indexes are one-based and column indexes zero-based. `parameterName(i)`
returns the original marker (`:x`, `@x`, `$x`, or numbered form) or null;
`parameterIndex(name)` returns zero if absent. Unbound parameters are NULL.
`bind(number|string, value)` resolves names exactly and rejects absent names or
out-of-range indexes. Binding is allowed only before execution or after reset.
`reset()` rewinds and invalidates the row but retains bindings. `clearBindings()`
sets every parameter to NULL and does not reset execution.

## Stepping, bounded work, and rows

```ts
await statement.step(options) // "row" | "done"
```

`"row"` and `"done"` are control outcomes, never exceptions. Execution runs in
bounded chunks and yields to the host between chunks, preserving VM state. It
checks the effective signal, deadline, and work budget between chunks and within
bounded traversal/recursion loops. Statement operation options may only tighten,
never relax, connection limits. `maxWorkUnits` is an implementation-defined stable
unit counter intended as a safety bound, not elapsed time or a compatibility/performance
promise. Other configured bounds include SQL/file bytes, rows, expression depth,
b-tree depth, and overflow-page traversal. A future implementation must document
its exact counters before claiming these controls work.

Cancellation, timeout, or limit failure halts the run and rejects the promise with
the matching typed error. The row is invalidated. The statement remains owned and
must be reset or finalized; `reset()` performs cleanup and then rethrows the saved
execution error. Since checks occur only at bounded checkpoints, deadlines are not
hard real-time deadlines. Asynchronous `step` allows same-agent abort delivery;
synchronous methods can observe only a signal/deadline already visible during
their bounded synchronous call.

Column access is valid only after `"row"` and until the next step attempt, reset,
finalize, or connection destruction. `columnCount` is prepared result width;
access without a current row is misuse. `columnMetadata(i)` preserves position and
returns a fresh immutable record, so duplicate display names are not collapsed.
`name` is always present. `declaredType`, `database`, `table`, and `origin` are null
where SQLite metadata is unavailable (including expressions as applicable), not
empty strings. Origin fields require the translated equivalent of SQLite column
metadata support.

`columnType(i)` returns the row cell's **initial** storage class and is stable for
that row even after typed conversion. This is a deliberate deterministic adaptation:
`sqlite3_column_type` after a converting C accessor is undefined. `column(i)`
returns that initial-class public value. Typed accessors implement SQLite's
`sqlite3_column_int64/double/text/blob` conversion behavior but are nullable:
`columnInteger`, `columnReal`, `columnText`, and `columnBlob` return `null` for SQL
NULL. Empty TEXT is `""`; empty BLOB is a zero-length `Uint8Array`, never null.
This avoids C's ambiguous zero-length BLOB pointer. Out-of-range indexes are
`sqlite`/`SQLITE_RANGE`; unsupported conversion cannot be approximated.

## Lifecycle and cleanup

Statements begin prepared, can move through running/current-row/done, can be reset
for reuse, and end finalized. `finalize()` always invalidates the row, releases
bindings/resources, and destroys the handle, even when it throws a saved execution
error. `reset()` likewise completes cleanup before reporting the prior error, but
keeps the statement and its bindings. Calling either a second time is `misuse`;
this explicit non-idempotence prevents accidental suppression of meaningful errors.
Every other operation on a finalized statement is misuse.

`close()` maps legacy `sqlite3_close`: if statements remain, it throws a
`sqlite` error with primary code `SQLITE_BUSY` and leaves the connection open and
usable. It never cascade-finalizes. With no dependents it releases resident bytes
and closes. `closeDeferred()` maps `sqlite3_close_v2`: it immediately marks the
connection zombie, rejects prepare and all other new connection operations, but
existing statements remain usable; finalizing the last statement performs deferred
connection cleanup. Repeating either close or using a fully closed connection is
misuse (rather than C's null-pointer OK adaptation). If statement cleanup reports
an earlier execution error, cleanup still completes; that earlier error is thrown,
while successful zombie deletion is not a competing error. This follows
`connectionIsBusy`, `sqlite3Close`, and `sqlite3LeaveMutexAndCloseZombie`
(`src/main.c`) plus reset/finalize cleanup (`src/vdbeapi.c`, `src/vdbeaux.c`).

GC is a leak backstop only. Applications must finalize statements and close their
connection. No finalizer timing or error reporting is part of the API.

## Errors

All library-detected failures are `JSQLiteError` with one `kind`:

- `sqlite`: SQL, binding-index, schema, database-format/corruption, and other
  SQLite-observable failures. `code` and `extendedCode` contain numeric SQLite
  primary/extended result codes.
- `transport`: Fetch/HTTP/CORS/body failures; `cause` may retain the host error.
- `cancelled`, `timeout`, `limit`: operation controls, not fabricated SQLite codes.
- `misuse`: JS API validation, illegal overlap/lifetime/index representation, or
  out-of-range bigint. (A SQLite-origin invalid bind/column index remains sqlite.)
- `unsupported`: a temporary untranslated in-scope feature **or** a permanent SPEC
  exclusion. The message identifies which and whether it is temporary/permanent.
- `internal`: an impossible translated-engine state, never converted to NULL/success.

For non-`sqlite` kinds, `code` and `extendedCode` are null. Errors preserve cleanup:
prepare failure leaks no statement; step failure invalidates its row; reset and
finalize report prior execution errors only after required cleanup. When cleanup
also detects an internal failure, the saved execution error is primary and cleanup
failure is attached as `cause`/aggregate diagnostic rather than replacing it.
No promise is made to catch host process termination or all host OOM failures.

Numeric constants are intentionally not declared in Stage 1; when implementation
adds them they must be sourced from the pin, not invented. Consumers may inspect
numeric codes and error kind without parsing messages.

## Limits and ownership summary

`WorkLimits` defaults are implementation constants that must be finite, documented,
and tested before runtime support is claimed. Callers can tighten them at open;
operation-level `maxWorkUnits` tightens the connection budget. `maxRows` counts
`"row"` outcomes across one execution until reset. Limits must cover parser
recursion, expression depth, page/b-tree/overflow traversal, and query loops as
required by SPEC. This Stage 1 contract does not falsely select numeric defaults
before measurements and engine consumers exist.

The connection exclusively owns resident database bytes and statements; a
statement owns binding copies and VM state; callers own values returned by column
methods. No public API exposes borrowed pages, pointers, mutable row arrays, native
destructors, or object-keyed rows.

## Source basis and exclusions

The pin is SQLite 3.53.4/source ID recorded in
`reference/sqlite/manifest.json`. Principal mappings are:

- `src/sqlite.h.in`: prepare v2/v3, bind, step, columns/metadata, reset/finalize
  contracts;
- `src/prepare.c`: `sqlite3LockAndPrepare`, v2/v3 retained SQL/tail, and
  `sqlite3Reprepare`;
- `src/vdbeapi.c`, `src/vdbeaux.c`: step/reset/finalize/clear-bindings, bind,
  column conversion and metadata;
- `src/vdbemem.c`: `sqlite3VdbeMemSetDouble` NaN/infinity behavior;
- `src/main.c`: `openDatabase`, busy close, zombie close, deferred cleanup;
- `test/close.test`, `test/capi3.test`, `test/capi3c.test`, and `test/bind.test`:
  future faithful Stage 2 lifecycle/tail/value/metadata assertions.

Permanent exclusions remain exactly those in SPEC: writes and transaction control,
runtime native/C/WASM backends, extension/host callback registration, CLI/server
surfaces, and sidecar recovery. Temporary gaps are broader today: there is no
runtime engine, Fetch implementation, parser, storage reader, planner, VDBE, or
oracle/test harness. Declarations and passing type checks prove contract coherence,
not SQLite compatibility.
